excerpt: 'This project aims to investigate the correlation between facial attractiveness and human behavior, particularly in the context of online dating. By using machine learning algorithms to predict facial beauty, we will explore the marginal utility of attractiveness in the online dating market. Our study will also examine how physical appearance affects human behavior and decision-making in the dating process. With a large dataset of profile pictures from various dating apps, we will train our model to accurately classify images based on their level of facial attractiveness. Through this study, we hope to provide insights on the significance of physical appearance in human behavior and decision-making, especially in the context of online dating.'
