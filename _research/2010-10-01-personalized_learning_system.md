In this line of research, we work together with the educational platform PaGamO to create a workable e-learning system. This study aims to enhance rural kids’ academic performance and support teachers in assessing their students’ progress. To this end, we apply the Rasch model, which interprets students’ performance as a function of students’ abilities and difficulties of items, to analyze the data. Under this structure, we estimate the difficulties of items and the trajectories of students’ abilities. Eventually, we hope to develop an algorithm based on abilities and difficulties to facilitate students’ learning performance.
