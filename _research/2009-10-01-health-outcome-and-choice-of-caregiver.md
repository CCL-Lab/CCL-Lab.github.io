excerpt: The purpose of this study is to investigate how the health outcomes of older adults are influenced by their choice of caregivers. Using data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA), we analyze the relationship between caregivers and older adults' health outcomes. Specifically, we describe the choice of caregivers and older adults' respective health outcomes for the caregivers. We also employ the instrument of caregiver reform to estimate the potential changes in health outcomes. This study provides insights into the impact of caregivers on the health of older adults, which can inform policies and interventions aimed at improving the health and well-being of older adults.
