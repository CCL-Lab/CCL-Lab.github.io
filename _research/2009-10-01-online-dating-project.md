excerpt: In collaboration with an online dating app company, we evaluate detailed user data on the two-sided matching market. Our projects include (1) estimating a spatial learning model, where the dating app users sequentially update their beliefs on match probabilities, (2) building a dashboard for the company to manage several experiments at once and to view statistically robust results, and (3) developing machine learning methods to rate the attractiveness of users’ photos.
