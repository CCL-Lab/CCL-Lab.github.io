excerpt: 'This project proposes an empirical Bayes method, called "EB with Optimal Shrinkage Trees", for estimating treatment effects in settings with many treatment arms and moderate sample sizes. It leverages auxiliary information from treatment characteristics by grouping similar treatment arms using a decision tree, then shrinking individual effect estimates towards the group average. The proposed method reduces mean squared errors compared to methods with no shrinkage or conventional EB methods that do not consider treatment characteristics. A consistent model selection procedure approximates the optimal tree, and simulations show reduced estimation errors, particularly when treatment characteristics highly correlate with treatment effects.

The research project focuses on the estimation of parameters in a non-linear y model, where the observables x and y are determined by an unobserved variable theta generated by a prior. In such cases, the traditional method of using the posterior mean of theta to run regression against y, which is accurate in linear models, may result in biased estimation. To address this issue, we propose a new method with its statistical properties and simulation examples. This project aims to improve parameter estimation in non-linear models under Empirical Bayes context and compare the performance with non-parametric methods.
